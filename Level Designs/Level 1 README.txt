The cat and home owner are sleeping by default.

If the player sprints near the cat, it will walk into the owner's bedroom and wake them up, causing the owner to patrol the whole house from top to bottom, then back to bed if the player isn't found.

If the owner enters the same room as the player, it's game over. 

If the player hides in the cupboard in the office, they won't be detected.

Safety/Exit zone is right outside the front door (where the player starts the level).
