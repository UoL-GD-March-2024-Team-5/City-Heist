Level 3: Corporate Crime

Level can be 1.5 to 2 times as wide as level 1 and 2 (sketch contained to one page for simplicity).

More rooms. More people. More loot. Takes a lot longer to collect everything. Multiple locks add additional delay.

[If time permits] Fire alarms on ground and top floors will draw all staff on that level to them when activated, allowing the player to steal or hide.

[If time permits] Turning lights off should draw staff in the same room to the switch to turn it back on. While the staff are occupied the player can steal or hide.

[Stretch] Very hard to get key in security office allows lockpick bypass

[Stretch] Security cameras
