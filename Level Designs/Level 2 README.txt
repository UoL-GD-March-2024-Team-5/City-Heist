Green = valuables
Yellow = activatable noise sources to attract residents
Blue = hiding spots
Lock symbol = takes 5 seconds to unlock (lockpicking)

Level mechanics
- Activating stero, washing machine, or jack-in-the-box (storage room) will attract father and mother until they are turned off
- If child (toddler, can't speak) sees player they will run to closest parent (father) and father will go upstairs to investigate playroom
- Mother patrols back and forth between bedroom and living room (bedroom -> bathroom -> down to kitchen -> living room -> then reverse
- All boxes in storage room are unmarked and all can be opened. One contains $2000 antique coin collection (valuable), another contains a jack-in-the-box, rest contain nothing (of value to the player)
